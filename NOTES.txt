PROFILING - http://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/opengl-timer-query/

-glGet returns current GL time
-but this is time after all previous commands have been SENT to the GPU - might not be done executing
-this should be pretty close to if you asked for CPU time before and after some GPU commands

	GLint64 timer;
	glGetInteger64v(GL_TIMESTAMP, &timer);

-getting elapsed time for something on the GPU: intuitively this requires the CPU to wait
-you can tell if a GPU task has finished using queries -> glGenQueries, glGetQueryObjectiv

	GLint64 startTime, stopTime; // handles for time
	unsigned int queryID[2]; // handles for queries on the GPU
	 
	// generate two queries
	glGenQueries(2, queryID);
	...
	// issue the first query
	// Records the time only after all previous 
	// commands have been completed
	glQueryCounter(queryID[0], GL_TIMESTAMP);
	 
	// call a sequence of OpenGL commands
	...
	// issue the second query
	// records the time when the sequence of OpenGL 
	// commands has been fully executed
	glQueryCounter(queryID[1], GL_TIMESTAMP);
	...
	// wait until the results are available
	unsigned int stopTimerAvailable = 0;
	// repeatedly ask for if the second query (issued after first) is available
	while (!stopTimerAvailable) {
	    glGetQueryObjectiv(queryID[1], 
	                               GL_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE, 
	                               &stopTimerAvailable);
	}
	 
	// get query results
	glGetQueryObjectui64v(queryID[0], GL_QUERY_RESULT, &startTime);
	glGetQueryObjectui64v(queryID[1], GL_QUERY_RESULT, &stopTime);
	 
	printf("Time spent on the GPU: %f ms\n", (stopTime - startTime) / 1000000.0);

-more compact way of doing this: glBeginQuery and glEndQuery with GL_TIME_ELAPSED
-can't interleave glBeginQuery and glEndQuery though

	GLuint query; // query handle
	GLuint64 elapsed_time;
	 
	glGenQueries(1, &query);
	glBeginQuery(GL_TIME_ELAPSED,query);
	 
	// call some OpenGL commands
	...
	 
	glEndQuery(GL_TIME_ELAPSED);
	 
	... 
	 
	// retrieving the recorded elapsed time
	// wait until the query result is available
	unsigned int done = 0;
	while (!done) {
	    glGetQueryObjectiv(query, 
	            GL_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE, 
	            &done);
	}
	 
	// get the query result
	glGetQueryObjectui64v(query, GL_QUERY_RESULT, &elapsed_time);
	printf("Time Elapsed: %f ms\n"m elapsed_time / 1000000.0);

-you can avoid stalling the CPU (having it wait for queries) by keeping two sets of queries
-you issue queries on one frame and then read queries for the previous frame
-because every time you call "render" you are making a "new frame"
-indicated by swapping frame buffers

	// call this function when initializating the OpenGL settings
	void genQueries() {
	 
	    glGenQueries(QUERY_COUNT, queryID[queryBackBuffer]);
	    glGenQueries(QUERY_COUNT, queryID[queryFrontBuffer]);
	 
	    // dummy query to prevent OpenGL errors from popping out
	    glQueryCounter(queryID[queryFrontBuffer][0], GL_TIMESTAMP);
	}
	 
	// aux function to keep the code simpler
	void swapQueryBuffers() {
	 
	    if (queryBackBuffer) {
	        queryBackBuffer = 0;
	        queryFrontBuffer = 1;
	    }
	    else {
	        queryBackBuffer = 1;
	        queryFrontBuffer = 0;
	    }
	}

	void renderFrame() {
	...
	glBeginQuery(GL_TIME_ELAPSED,queryID[queryBackBuffer][0]);
	 
	// call some OpenGL commands
	...
	glEndQuery(GL_TIME_ELAPSED);
	...
	glGetQueryObjectui64v(queryID[queryFrontBuffer][0], 
	                    GL_QUERY_RESULT, &timer2);
	swapQueryBuffers();
	 
	//swap frame buffers
	...
	 
	}

-so oct tree by z curve as I understand goes something like this:
0) compute AABB (can we parallelize this well?)
1) label all triangles with the Z curve index of their bins
2) parallel sort
3) build tree bottom-up as pointers in another buffer (buffer size determined by max tree depth
4) short stack traversal: each thread does a traversal, but tree height is limited
-problems with binning?
	-can we index by 2s instead of 1s? so 0 2 4 6 for z instead of 0 1 2 3 4?
	-then, triangles on borders (say, between cell 0 and cell 2) can be in "cell 3"
	-sort makes this chunk of memory contiguous for both adjacent cells
	-must understand Z curve to assess possibility -> ok no it's not doable
	-other option requires basically duplicating the triangle somehow
-other option: we place a cap for how many cells each triangle can be in and preallocate that much space
	-idea is we input into the algorithm a buffer of triangle indices
	-each triangle is identified by some constant number of contiguous array elements

	-for each og triangle index in parallel, fetch the triangle and compute the SFC index of its block
	-if the triangle fits in more than one block, use the rest of its space to specify the other block indices
		-so this part will be serial per triangle. no need for crazy atomics
	-then sort the list by SFC indices, build the tree
	-won't work well for large triangles, but honestly, there's not much that will
	-ok. do this. go read the rest of the SFC oct tree paper!

-alternative option is top-down construction
-at each stage, subdivide the pool of triangles into 8 pools
-can be done by ping-ponging
-allocating enough space allows binning, triangles in multiple pools
-problems:
	-virtually no parallelism in the first step
	-then 8 threads
	-then 64
	-then 512
-parallelism increases 8x with each pass -> if we go to a depth of 8 or 16, this gets awesome fast
-problem is that first pass, but this version handles binning MUCH better. worthwhile?
	-otherwise binning requires elaborate atomics
	-can also theoretically rebuild each frame at one depth
	-even more so if

-so: the intersection detection problem appears to have been an edge case
	-the models were such that the problem verts in cloth HAPPENED to align with verts on the mesh in init
	-Karl's suggested solution: jitter the model by some tiny offset
	-we replaced the blogspot triangle intersect with more canonical algorithm though -> yay!
	-worthwhile to confirm this case on an earlier branch maybe? -> use the debug buffer to indicate triangle intersects? -> might take too long. we're pretty sure this is the case anyway, in the worst edge cases we had 12 intersections, which kind of makes sense (6 entering, 6 exiting)
TODO:
-add imperceptible jitter option to loader
-fix the "nearest point on triangle" algorithm
-look at short stack traversal
-write up plans for acceleration structures
-add a proper animation system and bvh loader

12/25/2015
-working on fixing static intersection detection [done?]
	-leaving resolution for after this part...
	-problem seems to still be in detection raycasting
	-wat -> ok seems to have been a stupid logic error
	-but now seems to be causing major problems with the bear -> clothespins -> dammit
-work on fixing static intersection resolution
	-problem is still in the hack -> see collision resolution demo
	-also, how to deal with clothespins?!
		-ah. they're marked by mass, aren't they? maybe say "no handling" for clothespinned things?

12/24/2015
TODO:
-clean code
	-add a dedicated gl playground over in main [done]
	-add methods to load different sims [done]
	-give each mesh its own VAO [done-ish. complications with ssbos and VAOs]
-fix static collision resolution -> the hack is a problem
	-need "closest point on triangle" method -> blehhhhh
	-how to test this well?
		-so we have a test scene to handle on situation
		-there still seem to be phantom collisions/resolutions going on


12/21-22/2015
TODO:
-fix static collision resolution -> the hack is a problem
	-need "closest point on triangle" method -> blehhhhh
	-how to test this well?
-add bvh capability
	-uv and weight maps?
	-or try to borrow the fbx loader from 562?
-read up on self collision
-read up on stackless tree traversal

Kai:
-a VAO basically stores all the buffers bound to it
-in games, every object has a VAO with bound buffers so when you draw you don't have to keep rebinding

TODO:
-add animation system -> biggie, what do?
	-not enough time to do a full weighted mesh loader
		-would probably want an obj library for this...
		-would also need to load mesh weights as images -> whole other ball of dirt
		-unless... we wrote a really lousy FBX ascii parser that only gets vertices and skin weights -> doable?
	-bvh loader and player: http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/bvh-file-loading-and-displaying-r3295
	-alternatively, for now just load a series of transformations and use them to keyframe a single mesh -> return of the low-poly panda
-ok. basic animation system TODO:
	-add transformation state to rbody [done]
	-add a "get matrix at time" method [done]
	-add a shader that transforms the mesh based on this new transformation [done]
	-give the mesh an "init positions" ssbo to go with the "positions" ssbo [done]

-get nonstatic collision [done enough to wear a dress]
	-one idea: add static collision handling -> not so bad, just another shader stage or a modification to the existing one. also, we need this pretty bad
		-way we're doing continuous collision handling: store a normal and a distance. distance + knowledge of old/new positions lets you compute entry point
		-static collision works by requiring a point that you move towards along with a normal. point isn't necessarily in the moving direction
			-whatever happens, we'll probably use w to determine if this is static of continuous collision (continuous.w < 1.0)
			-could provide the point directly and use the distance as a triangle index + 2
			-could add more buffers, more writes -> messier
			-could move the "old position" so that the resulting "new - old" gives the right direction for resolution -> hmmmmmmm...
				-tbh, this would also make velocity update much easier <- ok let's do this one

		-generating static collisions:
			-need to do "closest point on triangle to vertex" -> hmmm...
			-find shortest distance point -> plane
			-check if point is in triangle using barycentric
			-if not, check for shortest distance to each edge
			-if still no good, do shortest distance to each vertex in triangle

			-approximation: split triangle sierpinsky style and check against each centroid. iterate on the closest triangle -> faster? slower? more registers? more branching? accurate enough?
			-other other idea: just check against vertices and centroids, don't get the "true" best position. we project back along the normal anyway. -> try this first. hacky, but fast.

			-OBSERVATION: just detecting this case and advecting backwards seems to work surprisingly ok with a static collider mesh. surprise! -> well... it's stable at least
				-so... could we just pass in the collider's current and future positions? and use that "velocity" to update the advecting direction here?
				-currently collision counting to determine internalness is very, VERY buggy.
			-current bug seems to be that the shader counts too many collisions for some vertices

	-other idea: pass the current timestep and future timestep mesh to the constraint generator, add a buffer for "velocity to add..." -> uhhhh. no.

-TODO as an analysis maybe? add a stage to precompute and cache all the normals so you don't have to calculate them in collision checking.

-add a good way to pin things besides hardcoding indices -> may have to just wait
	-would involve transferring back to CPU and raycasting, which is ok
	-add drawing for pins -> so you can turn them off
	-would involve a struct for pins. would need to run external constraints at most once per every mesh/cloth combo

-ok. need to change constraints so they don't include K and instead have a mesh ID in w
-this mesh ID will indicate whether or not the shader should evaluate the constraint right now
-mesh ID to evaluate must be passed into the shader as a uniform then
-cloth must keep track of which SSBOs it is pinned to -> vector of GLuints
-all internal constraints will have the mesh's SSBO value as identity
-all external constraints will have other meshes' SSBO values as identity

TODO:
-modify shader to once again take in K, take in a mesh ID, and eval based on that [done]
-modify shader invoking code to provide K and mesh ID [done]
-add "pinned to me" vector and handling to cloth [done]
-add "pinned to this cloth" handling to per-cloth handler [done]
-try pinning by raycasting again? -> other option is to ctrl-F point coordinates using blender. also ok.
-or write a little method that generates shoulder pins for clothes



12/09/2015
-confirmed: compute shader memory can be incoherent: https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Memory_Model
-basically just need to do glMemoryBarrier(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BARRIER_BIT) after each PBD stage
-guess the lab computers are slower on CPU than on GPU?

TODO
-clean the stuff used to find the barrier problem [done]
-fix static collision [done!]
-we possibly need more edges to get a nice sim. like, Xs for each quad. [done]
-get nonstatic collision
-add animation system -> biggie
-make meshes able to draw in different colors... big problem right now [done]
-add proper damping?
	-will probably require implementing scan -> worthwhile? having "real" damping might not even be noticeable
-add a good way to pin things besides hardcoding indices -> would involve raycasting

12/08/2015
WEIRD DRIPPY CLOTH WITH NO CONSTRAINTS ISSUE
-tried it in the lab, no problems there?
-Kai suspects a memory issue of some kind -> hmmm will keep looking
-more observations:
	-more printing between shader stages == more stable simulation
	-are the stages dispatching too close together? -> going from one stage to another too soon -> update positions before velocities are done
		-how can I make them wait?
		-would also make sense of the part where not updating velocity in stage 7 improves stability but only up to a point.
	-tomorrow: try condensing shader stages, like squishing external forces + prediction into a single stage. -> means giving up on good damping though
		-could indicate the dispatch problem

TODO
-strip the prog planet stuff, don't need that anymore [done]
-add stage after PBD that looks at collision constraints, updates velocities, then clears collision constraints
-make the "bounce" in the collision resolution shader a uniform

12/07/2015

TODO:
-make all shaders aware of data amount (aka idx at which to do nothing and return) [done]
-change constraint format: [done]
	-neg length indicates a pin
	-pin still has source and dest in the usual way
	-item 4 in the vec4 is the constraint's K. so K will no longer be a uniform
	-rename in shader to be more clear
	-realization: we can simplify the cloth projecting shader a LOT b/c the external constraints case is invoked completely separately [done]
-add an inverse mass buffer [done]
	-just use w in the pos buffer to store weights
	-and then use w in the predpos1 and predpos2 buffers to store inverse mass
-add an "inverse mass update" shader that scans the pin constraints and updates the inverse masses [done]

-add a compute shader to do obj mesh animation using a matrix and a weight buffer
-this way we can animate a mesh moving and pin things to it at least
-add a shader for obj collision detect and collision constraint gen
	-how does an obj collision constraint work? is it just another buffer of pin constraints? gets refreshed every frame? -> in this case it's a REALLY good idea to modify weights on the GPU
	-but read the section in the paper. there should be... time
	-how to do it with an animated mesh? just use the mesh's updated position? worth trying
		-in that case, need to handle both static and nonstatic in Muller. oh boy.
	-ok: so collision constraints are as follows:
		-direction to move p in (usually, surface normal at collision)
		-magnitude to move p by
	-collision constraint you're doing is very different from muller
	-the C in muller just replaces the C in the inner constraint solver for muller's
	-can still use vec4 buffers: store normal (really) and use parametric to get q based on p

12/06/2015
-keep debugging
	-right now the cloth is "too stretchy"
	-look at how attachment constraints SHOULD be handled?
	-in 563 it was basically just moved back into place
	-Muller suggests making the pinned position's inverse mass 0 so nothing can move it.
		-so in a constraint, this will give the "other" item in the constraint a greater dp
		-options:
			-1 add a weight buffer, handle updating it w/constraints on the CPU
			-2 add an "update weights" shader stage that runs per constraint and updates weights automatically
			-no matter what we do, pin constraints on GPU must be updated by buffering it
			-updating weights on CPU basically doubles number of things that must be sent to the GPU
			-doing it on the GPU could lead to some "collisions" but we don't really care
			-and it doesn't have to be run on every frame, unless we weight for friction constraints
			-so let's do it in an additional shader stage. faster too if # pins is huge
			-may need to change how pin constraints are done in general:
				-pins may be fixed in space (init pos pins)
				-but pins may also be attached to a mesh in the future
				-let's use rest length as an indicator of "pin-ness" instead of index
					-negative rest length == "this is a pin"
					-and then the indices are just indices as always
					-we'll pass in a POS buffer into the shader that can be used as a source for pinning
						-this can either be an animated mesh's vertices or the cloth's own positions

-get at least the framework for animated mesh collision in debuggable condition
	-look at 277 skinning. implement something basic like that on compute shader
	-just import a mesh with a single skeleton joint for now
	-bvh can come later?

	-mesh collision detect:
		-so most basic idea is to check pPos vs prevPos as a line seg, check with every triangle
		-but do we also need to assess per-vertex if the vertex is "inside" the mesh?
			-would certainly be slow
			-would also need to determine nearest mesh vertex, push in that direction
			-maybe we can do a pair of collision detection shaders
			-what it could do:
				-raycast towards the predicted position
				-if ISX coount is even, check for collision, generate constraint
				-if ISX count is odd...
					-find the nearest mesh vertex -> acceleratable
					-push out?
					-or push out along predicted position vector?

		-other options: compute mesh AABBs? if the vertex is within one, push out? -> which dir?
		-we can't compute this AABB on the GPU either, no float atomics

-add support for raycasting pins? -> not yet

12/05/2015
-add more cam/playback controls [done]
-make constants in compute shaders into uniforms [done]
-DEBUG THE SIMULATION
	-the 563 sim counts triangle edges as well. would this help with stability? -> removing them in 563 doesn't change that sim's stability
	-increasing iterations per timestep improves stability to a point, but things still go crazy
	-decreasing timestep doesn't help
	-behavior changes significantly if I reverse the order in which the constraints are projected
	-there's... a phantom pin?
	-ok part of the stability problem: a whole internal constraint buffer was getting overwritten b/c forgot to bind another buffer later before uploading a bunch of bogus
-add naive mesh collision detect!

12/04/2015

TODO
-clean pipeline. eyeball debug.
	-can we merge damp velocities and predict positions? -> except damp velocities could end up quite complex. so not yet.
	-RENAME THINGS RIGHT
	-make constants uniforms!

-debug simulation stability
	-why is there still instability with no constraint projection? numerical error?
	-hmmm... was doing v = v + f instead of v = v + f * dt. seems a little better. [done]

-do proper damping
	-may need to look at and implement scan algorithm
	-assess the CPU version w/out damping. does that solve our stability problem?
	-doesn't look like damping is the source of instability

-add obj checking and constraint generation
-ask Kai about suggestions on animation import formats
	-bvh + obj + skin weights? autoskin in the app if can't export weights?
		-also, writing a bvh player won't be easy
	-borrow from the current 462 bvh player?
	-something like obj sequence or baked fbx isn't good, too slow to load each frame

12/01/2015
-so the vec4 thing is part of std430: buffers are always treated as vec4s, although you can interpret as vec3s in the shader -> thanks Kai!
-we can get things back from the GPU! all about the bufMask. see the writeup -> thanks Kai!

-so there's something wrong with drawing imported meshes right now

-strip out old code for generating meshes and constraints -> correction: add a "simualtion" class [done]
-get meshes importing drawing -> correciton: add a "simulation" class [done]

	-external forces
	-damp velocities (something basic for now)
	-predict positions

	x.block_vector(m_p2) += k_prime * dp2;

	-update positions and velocities
-pbd pipeline

11/28/2015
-post Thanksgiving!
-took a look at PBD paper, b/c Harmony suggested implementing PBD instead
-also took a look at the PBD hw
-we may just reject bending constraints for now. add them in if necessary

PBD
-so PBD does an explicit euler step with external forces and then corrects resulting positions and velocities using constraints
-in this case, the constraints are cloth-y -> mass spring system
-so it's "unconditionally stable"
-presumably each step in the PBD will need to be its own shader
-when we get to collision detect, we'll also need to add shader collision check -> mmmm
	-perhaps we'll need another buffer of "collisions" per point
	-b/c if there's n points there's at most n collision constraints, right?
	-how to deal with edges... an ongoing problem

TODO
-make "cloth" and "noncloth" classes [done]
	-need to have GL pointers to buffers
-get obj loading and drawing working
-add additional kernels

11/23-24/2015
TODO:
-figure out what's causing drawing in weird space. ask Kai? [done, vec4 vs vec3]
-move mesh into its own class. load an obj instead of doing your jank thing
	-needs to hold its own pointers to buffers and stuff
	-can we put the GL calls in there? or would it make more sense for this to be a struct?
-figure out how to draw polys (read about geometry shaders)
-read up on compute shader memory
-add a plane and some basic shading

-okay. the lack of atomics for floats is a problem. options:
	-look into manually locking
	-look into adding an int buffer to do something
	-float packing (bad idea?)
	-pack the constraints so there's no interference. -> this is Kai sanctioned
		-there's at most 8 constraints influencing each point, we need 8 buffers this way
		-in theory if the mesh is big enough we don't even have to worry about GPU saturation problems
		-and locks/atomics basically serialize too, right?

BASIC INTEGRATOR NOTES
-we'll do a basic euler for now
-steps:
	-compute forces
	-compute external forces
	-resolve constraints
	-damp velocity
	-render
-we'll also try ping-ponging
-but how to compute forces? -> I... guess we didn't have to do this -> actually, we did
-so go read the 563 HW writeup

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES AND QUESTIONS
-we need a datastructure to show connectivity
-how are we going to go from vertices to triangles? hmmm...

BASIC INTEGRATOR WORKFLOW AND REQUIREMENTS
-so we need a buffer of constraints
	-we can use vec3s for these: -> can we just adapt the acceleration buffer? probably.
		-x = point idx 1
		-y = point idx 2
		-z = rest length
	-we'll need a force buffer if we're parallelizing over constraints -> should just be another vec3
		-may need to use atomics to do force accumulation
	-for now we'll hardcode that indices N - 2 and N - 1 are fixed constraints

	1) kernel -> compute external forces -> easy peasy? for now
	2) kernel -> for each constraint, compute internal force contribution
	3) kernel -> integrate explicit euler -> kernel
	4) kernel -> damp velocity
	5) draw

TODO:
-add host buffers. modify position generation to produce a grid [done, I think?]
-generate vec3 constraints [done, I think?]
-add new compute shaders and setup [done, I think?]
-add compute step invocations [done, I think?]
